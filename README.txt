# CSC 365 Paired Programming #3 Student Maintenance
## Written by: Rivar Yoder and Lindsay Green
The program presents the user with a menu where they can enter 1-4 (0 to end program) to either list all students, add a student, update a student, or delete a student. A function will run for each option and all input uses a seperate moduel to validate all data input. List all students runs a for loop to present the user with the currently entered students. Add a student allows the user to enter in students that are assigned a dictionary key, each key has a sub dictionary that links the first name to the last name. Update a student has the only two input commands that allows the user to change any currently existing names by pulling their ID. Delete a student allows the user to delete a student and the dictionary will not reuse any previously linked keys in the dictionary. Any changes must be confirmed by the user.
